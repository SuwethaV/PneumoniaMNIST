ML libraries and meaning:
    1.Pytorch-build ,train neural network
    2.Tensorvision-Used for data processing(resize images,converts the images into tensors)
        what is tensor?
        A multi dimensionsal array similar as numpy.faster GPU computation
    3.TQDm-To show training and validation progress.
Datapreprocessing and its steps:
    1.Load the dataset,
    2.Resize the image,
    3.Data Normalisation,
    4.Data Augmentation,
    5.Tensor conversion
    6.Noise Reduction
